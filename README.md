# Seaport-Tracker

A Project for my CMSC 335 class.
Program Name: Sea Port Tracker Program
Program Purpose: Read data files of different sea ports by use of 'world' text docs.
This program was to also show and practice using inheritance, and data structures and algorithms like HashMaps, Comparable, & Comparator to help sort data.

The user has to upload the appropriate world text doc that contains all the seaport information (provided in the appropriate folder). From there, the user can see the world text doc and its seaports and ships with its personnel.
The user can sort the world and see it listed and or use a JTree for better focus.

A JAR file is already provided to use the program.
